## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using Decision Tree Techniques for Heart Disease Prediction System.

- What is the background of your project?

Heart disease is a leading cause of premature death in the world.Predicting the outcome of disease is the challenging task.Data mining is involved to automatically infer diagnostic rules and help specialists to make diagnosis process more reliable.Several data mining techniques are used by researchers to help health care professionals to predict the heart disease.Random forest is an ensemble and most accurate learning algorithm,suitable for medical applications.

- Business Problem Statement:

In this paper ,I  propose a classification model which uses Decisions Tree as classifier to predict heart disease. The experimental results have shown that my approach improves classification accuracy compared to other classification approaches,and the presented model can be successfully used by health care professional for predicting heart disease.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The data given to us by Upgrad.

## Conclusions
- 1.Lending Club will be in profit if they give more loan amount as interest rate increases with higher loan amount
- 2.A-grade is a top letter grade for a lender to assign to a borrower.Grades should be evaluated thoroughly before lending money
- 3.A derogatory item is an entry that may be considered negative by lenders because it indicates risk and hurts your ability to qualify for credit or other services. Public records and collections are derogatory items because they reflect financial obligations that were not paid as agreed.Those who already have pub_rec value 1 or 2 have charged off chances higher than who have no Derogatory Public Record.pub_rec count 3-4 has less numbers so cannot reach on any conclusions.
- 4.States NV,CA and FL states shows good number of charged offs in good number of applications.So, Lending Club should issue less loans in these states.
- 5.Those who are not working or have less than 1 year of work experience have high chances of getting charged off.So, Lending Club should issue less loans to these kind of applicants.
- 6.Small Business Owners default most.So, Lending Club should issue less loans to these kind of applicants.
